        <p>
          The first thing I paid attention to was the abstract image of the
          building or artwork. This, along with the bright and warm colors of
          the webpage, made me feel curious and excited, creating a desire to
          discover more. Unlike most websites that start with a lot of text,
          this one presented nothing but an abstract image, which immediately
          piqued my interest.

          I spent the most time on the first page where I hover my mouse and
          there are some words appear, it seems random at first but it is
          actually about the designerâ€™s thoughts about the artwork so it was
          quite interesting to hover around to read these. It also looks like a
          pentool that leaves a footprint/mark after your path.

          The most common action was scrolling. The entire experience is driven
          by this single interaction. I just scrolled, and the animations and
          movements appeared in a movie, similar to watching a film,
          as the website provided a lot of video content and dynamic
          descriptions.

          I think the primary goal is to provide a comprehensive introduction to
          the design and philosophy behind the architecture. By using an
          abstract sketch initially, the experience intentionally makes users
          confused and curious. This encourages them to engage more deeply and
          spend time trying to understand the meaning behind the abstract form
          before discovering the full context.

          Throughout the journey of navigating the website, every single element
          and interaction, especially the media like pictures or videos are
          related to the primary goal, constantly reminding me about the

          Even the abstract images are about the main element,
          especially the match-cut part, which is the best. It makes the
          experience feel more meaningful, and people will remember it longer
          because in the beginning they don't know what the abstract picture is,
          and when they find out through the match cut, they will remember it
          longer

          The experience communicates how it should be interacted with through

          and fun, enhancing the userâ€™s curiosity without requiring complex
          instructions. If a section is long or complicated, the design
          maintains a simple, singular interaction (scrolling), which makes it
          clear that the user should continue forward along the single-path
          narrative.

          The elements are all related to the main subject, which is the

          immersive experience, so after leaving the webpage, I am already very
          sure about what the webpage is about. </p>

          <p>Visuals: They show evidence and make the experience less boring than if there were just words like the movement of the camera angles and the animation and the audience just need to scroll by mouse. This
          helps me identify which sections I might want to read more about
          instead of having to read everything. It also keeps people focused on
          the need to keep scrolling. </p>

          <p>Sound: The music is not too loud or
          disturbing but somehow makes me concentrate well. I think this is
          because it is a classical music piece with no lyrics, so it merges
          well with the visuals and the content.</p>

          The references are intended to make me feel calm and intellectually

          <p>The length was too long even though I tried to see the table of contents. Some parts are
          way too long that I cannot start in the middle of the content, but I
          have to start over again. It's getting boring over time because it
          mostly just has one interaction. My hand got a bit tired because I had
          to scroll all the time, and it was too long without many interactions
          throughout the process. I had to scroll it smoothly so the transitions
          and animations would play smoothly.

          I love how they deliver this to the audience in a way that makes it
          feel like an experience of watching a movie or a show rather than
          scrolling a webpage. Even though most of the interaction is scrolling,
          they make it feel like I am an audience member watching a classic
          musical show by having this classical music. The animation of zooming
          in and out of the building is so smart and interesting to watch.Z
