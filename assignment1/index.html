    <h1>My 1st Assignment</h1>
    1) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
    experience? Abstract image of the building/artwork make me curious about
    what is this ? 2) Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of
    each of your discrete actions. abstract image - match cut for transition 3)
    What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with? The
    first page when I hover my mouse and some words appear, it seems random at
    first but it is actually about the designer’s thoughts about the artwork so
    it was quite interesting to hover around to read these. It also looks like a
    pentool that leaves a footprint/mark after your path. 4) What was the most
    common action in your two minute interaction with the experience? scrolling,
    because the main interaction I have to do is scroll to see the other pages
    and animation. ? 5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of
    the interactive experience? I think their primary goal is to introduce their
    design/architect which is Make me confused because they showed an abstract
    sketching of the architect and abstract is not easy to understand at the
    first sight and make people curious and staring into it longer in order to
    giải what is that about before given up or search for reference meaning from
    the author or the internet 6) How does the interactive experience
    communicate this primary goal? Throughout the journey of going around the
    website, every single element, interaction especially media like pictures or
    video 7) What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
    with over time? (For how long and how many different times) I think the
    experience has to make you feel in some way and has to be interesting enough
    to keep the users continuing to discover the website. not long if it is
    complicated, but short if it is simple and interesting 8) How does the
    interactive experience communicate how it should be interacted with over
    time? The interaction is interesting, fun and enhances people's curiosity.
    One more important thing is that it has to be simple and if it is
    complicated, it has to have an instruction of how to interact but not too
    long. 9) What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
    reference? Images, videos, sound/music, 10) What does this reference/s
    communicate to you about how you should act when engaging with your research
    experience? Both are related to the main thing which is that architects keep
    reminding me about it through experience , so after getting out of the
    webpage I would already be too sure about what the webpage is about, which
    is that architect. visual: It shows evidence and it would be less boring to
    watch if there are just words so that I will know which one I may want to
    read more about rather than reading all of them. Keep people concentrate
    that they have to keep scrolling sound: the music is not too loud and not
    disturbing but somehow makes me concentrate well, i think it’s because it is
    a classical music and it has no lyrics so it merged well with the visual and
    the content. 11) What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you
    should feel when engaging with your research experience? calm and interest
    thing 12) What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and
    what makes that part frustrating? I think it is always the first part when I
    first encounter the web and it shows this abstract image which I have no
    idea what it is about and I have to find out by myself by clicking around
    and try to interact in different ways to see the content. It was too long
    even though I tried to see the table of contents. Some parts are way too
    long that I cannot start in the middle of the content but I have to start
    over again. It's getting boring over time because it mostly just has one
    interaction. a bit mỏi tay cause I have to scroll all the time and it is too
    long without many interaction throughout the process and I have to scroll it
    smoothly that cannot be stop in the middle so I can the the
    transition/animation smoothly. 13) What is the most satisfying part of the
    interaction to you and what makes that part satisfying? I love that how they
    delivery this to the audience the way that makes it like an experience of
    watching a moving or a show rather than scrolling a web even though most of
    the interaction is scrolling, but they make it like I am the audience
    watching a classic musical show by having this classical music and the
    animation of zoom in and out of the building is so smart and interesting to
    watch. What are discrete actions? Can I add an image when I explain? Like
    capture a part of that website?
