          1. What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting
          with the experience?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The first thing I paid attention to was the abstract image of the
          building or artwork. This, along with the bright and warm colors of
          the webpage, made me feel curious and excited, creating a desire to
          discover more. Unlike most websites that start with a lot of text,
          this one presented nothing but an abstract image, which immediately
          piqued my interest.

          2. Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of
          your discrete actions.
        </h3>
        <p>
          I clicked on the blank space as instructed to begin the experience. I
          observed the main abstract image and text appear, interacting by
          hovering to reveal information about the artist's thoughts. I started
          scrolling, which triggered the image of the architect to appear. As I
          continued to scroll, the camera zoomed in on the architecture, and
          descriptions appeared like subtitles. I continued to scroll to see the
          image change angles and zoom in and out. I kept scrolling to see a
          video montage and an article about the building's history. I clicked
          on buttons to navigate horizontally to new pages. I watched a video
          explaining the design process and the sound engineering inside the
          building. I scrolled to see a montage of people playing music and
          enjoying the space. Finally, I scrolled to the end to find the "sales"
          section and the credits. .

          3. What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging
          with?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I spent the most time on the first page where I hover my mouse and
          there are some words appear, it seems random at first but it is
          actually about the designer’s thoughts about the artwork so it was
          quite interesting to hover around to read these. It also looks like a
          pentool that leaves a footprint/mark after your path.

          4. What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with
          the experience?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The most common action was scrolling. The entire experience is driven
          by this single interaction. I just scrolled, and the animations and
          movements appeared in a cinematic fashion, similar to watching a film,
          as the website provided a lot of video content and dynamic
          descriptions.

          5. What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the
          interactive experience?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I think the primary goal is to provide a comprehensive introduction to
          the design and philosophy behind the architecture. By using an
          abstract sketch initially, the experience intentionally makes users
          confused and curious. This encourages them to engage more deeply and
          spend time trying to understand the meaning behind the abstract form
          before discovering the full context.

        <h3>
          6. How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
        </h3>
        <p>
          Throughout the journey of navigating the website, every single element
          and interaction, especially the media like pictures or videos—are
          related to the primary goal, constantly reminding me about the
          building. Even the abstract images are about the main element,
          especially the match-cut part, which is the best. It makes the
          experience feel more meaningful, and people will remember it longer
          because in the beginning they don't know what the abstract picture is,
          and when they find out through the match cut, they will remember it
          longer

          7. What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted
          with over time?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I think the experience is designed to make the audience feel the
          experience of being in that building in a specific way and it has to
          be interesting enough to keep users continuing to discover the
          website. It is not meant to be a long experience if it is complicated,
          but it is a short one if it is simple and interesting.

        <h3>
          8. How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
          interacted with over time?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The experience communicates how it should be interacted with through
          its intuitive and simple navigation. It is designed to be interesting
          and fun, enhancing the user’s curiosity without requiring complex
          instructions. If a section is long or complicated, the design
          maintains a simple, singular interaction (scrolling), which makes it
          clear that the user should continue forward along the single-path
          narrative.

          9. What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
          reference?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The experience references various media forms, including images, video
          (with multiple embedded clips), and sound/music. It also incorporates
          elements of architectural documentation like sketches and models, and
          presents them in a way that feels like a cinematic documentary.

          10. What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should
          act when engaging with your research experience?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The elements are all related to the main subject, which is the
          architect. They constantly remind me about the architect through the
          immersive experience, so after leaving the webpage, I am already very
          sure about what the webpage is about. Visuals: They show evidence and
          make the experience less boring than if there were just words. This
          helps me identify which sections I might want to read more about
          instead of having to read everything. It also keeps people focused on
          the need to keep scrolling. Sound: The music is not too loud or
          disturbing but somehow makes me concentrate well. I think this is
          because it is a classical music piece with no lyrics, so it merges
          well with the visuals and the content.

          feel when engaging with your research experience?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The references are intended to make me feel calm and intellectually
          engaged. The classical music establishes a peaceful and sophisticated
          mood. Combined with the pacing and visual flow, it makes me feel like
          I am in a focused state, ready to absorb the content without
          distraction.

          12. What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and
          what makes that part frustrating?
        </h3>
        <p>
          The most frustrating part I think is always the first part when I
          first encounter the web, and it shows this abstract image which I have
          no idea about. I have to find out by myself by clicking around and
          trying to interact in different ways to see the content. It was too
          long even though I tried to see the table of contents. Some parts are
          way too long that I cannot start in the middle of the content, but I
          have to start over again. It's getting boring over time because it
          mostly just has one interaction. My hand got a bit tired because I had
          to scroll all the time, and it was too long without many interactions
          throughout the process. I had to scroll it smoothly so the transitions
          and animations would play smoothly.

          what makes that part satisfying?
        </h3>
        <p>
          I love how they deliver this to the audience in a way that makes it
          feel like an experience of watching a movie or a show rather than
          scrolling a webpage. Even though most of the interaction is scrolling,
          they make it feel like I am an audience member watching a classic
          musical show by having this classical music. The animation of zooming
          in and out of the building is so smart and interesting to watch.Z
